ContinuousFlappyBird: an experimental framework for research on RL in aDBS
================

This repo contains a set of reinforcement learning agents (DQN, A2C, PPO) partially adopted from OpenAI baseline implementations. They are used to learn control strategies in OpeAi gym wrapped environments. 

How to for Users
----------------
In /examples you can find details on how to use the implemented environments and how to learn control strategies with the implemented RL agents.
